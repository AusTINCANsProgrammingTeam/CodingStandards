# Coding Standards
Note this is a work in progress.

Please read https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html

## Constants
Constants should only exist in a Constants file at the root src directory (same spot as Robot.java).

## Branching Strategy
When a developer starts working on a feature they will create a branch from their starting point(probably main). This branch will be named feature/short-description-of-feature. All work releated to that feature will be done in that branch, once all development is finished the developer will create a merge request to merge the feature branch into main. Please name the merge request in the following format `Merge: Feature Short Description`. Once the merge request has been created please assign a mentor as the reviewer.
